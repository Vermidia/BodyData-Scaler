# BodyData-Scaler
Simple C# program that scales bodydata. It's meant to be used with programs like [this one](https://github.com/pdJeeves/c16scaler) to convert creature sprites to different sizes while making sure the arms and legs are still attached in the right places.

It's only be tested with C3 sprites, but since the ATT files change so little in between games, it should work with all of them.
